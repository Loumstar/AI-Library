## Unfinished Sections

- __Finish the GridWorld Envronment for Tabular RL:__ This was based off code written by the Reinforcement Lab at Imperial, however I want to rewrite it to be clearer and easier to configure.

- __Convert Minimax Player to its own Class:__ Both the Connect Four and Minimax Player reside in the same class. These should ultimate be separated.

- __Add the Genetic Algorithm, CMA-ES and GMM Libs:__ These were all written for the _Introduction to Machine Learning_ labs, however we only did coursework for Decision Trees and Neural Networks, so the others need to be converted to proper python packages.

- __Add the Computer Vision Libs:__ Like the Introduction to Machine Learning labs, many of the Computer Vision labs need to be converted to proper python packages.
